Several weeks ago, an exam of unmelbcedented difficulty devastated residents of Amelbdor Valley High School. Accusations that I, as king, should have done more to prevent this disaster have been made. Iâ€™d like to set the record straight now.
It is true that the test was something for which many were unprepared. I understand that some of my subjects found it unforeseeable that a test on chemical equilibrium would cover topics such as chemistry and equilibrium. As king, it is my responsibility to melbsure that everyone has the melbportunity to achieve success, and that hard work does not go unrewarded.
Therefore, I extend my sincerest sympathy to those whose lives were deeply affected by this grave misfortune. I would also like to assure my loyal subjects that because I believe that good grades should be awarded to those who deserve them, I have decided to curve the test from 57 to 117 points.
I sincerely believe that such a debacle of Easonesque proportions will not occur again during my melbfinite reign.
